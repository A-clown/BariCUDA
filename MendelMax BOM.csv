If you only get one bag, you can probably source individual replacement screws at Fastenal or another local source, but they are at a substantial premium. You will almost certainly need spares to add accessories. I prefer stainless steel for purely aesthetic reasons, but you can save a couple dollars by using Zinc or Black Oxide. I recommend Socket Head screws, but phillips or other M5-.8 machine screws will also work, but they are more fiddly to assemble."608ZZ Bearings,bearings,x,608ZZ10,VXB.com,7,7,$0.50 ,$3.50 ,MendelMax,"2 each are used for the X & Y idlers, 3 for the Wade's extruder. You will also need four if you use the suggested filament spool.

This should improve reliability and extend motor life.

Type O1 or W1 is usually cheapest and are perfectly suited to what we need.  Stainless is also fine, but is considerably more expensive. Plain steel rods from a hardware store are not recommended, and zinc coated rods are not suitable.

Zinc coated is fine. Thin nuts are preferable to normal nuts since they can be used in place of t-slot nuts in a pinch, and even used as post-install nuts (they can be inserted through the top of the slot after the bot is assembled).""M3-.50, 10mm long",hardware,x,91290A115,McMaster,20,1,$4.48 ,$4.48 ,MendelMax,"McMaster part is for a box of 100.

Thease are a bit more expensive, but they are basicalaly foolproof, whereas the Igus bushings required a fairly high-precision mounting block that was difficult to reproduce accurately on a RepRap. MANY other choices are available, including LM8UU's, printed bushings, etc, but this is a good, inexpensive bushing that is very well suited to our application. Please note, SDP offers similar Bronze bushings that are a great choice with precision linear shafting, but are not recommended with drill rod.
